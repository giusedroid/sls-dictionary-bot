## What

![Databot](assets/img/data-bot-2.gif)
This repo provisions a Slack chat bot on AWS.  
The bot will reply to mentions and direct messages.  
In this first release the only available instruction is `search: <YOUR TERM>` to get a definition stored in DynamoDB.  
It's written in NodeJS with Serverless Framework and a bit of CloudFormation.  

### Architecture

![Serverless Slack Bot Architecture](assets/img/sls-bot.png)

### Dependencies

- UNIX/LINUX OS to run it locally
- Use [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) if possible.
- Node 8.10 (as this is the lambda target runtime)
- The [AWS cli](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/)

## Configure it

Most of the configuration is provided through environmental variables (both for your CI and local environment).  
A number of manual operations is still needed to get the bot up and running.

### Slack App

- Create a new Slack Workspace if you don't have one. Follow the instructions [here](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/206845317-Create-a-Slack-workspace)
- Log in to your workspace
- Take note of a `channel id` you want to use to test your bot. You can find such id by right-clicking on the channel name and selecting `Copy Link`. The id is the last element of the path. E.g., in `https://my-workspace.slack.com/messages/C01234567`, the id is `C01234567`. Use this vaule to populate the environment variable `SLACK_TEST_CHANNEL` (see the dedicated section)
- Create a new Slack App [here](https://api.slack.com/apps?new_app=1)
- In the **Add Features and functionality** choose **Bots** or tap on **Bot Users** in the menu on the left
  - Tap on **Add a Bot User**, fill in the required fields **Display name**, **Default username** and switch on **Always Show My Bot as Online**
  - Tap on **Add Bot User**
- Tap on **oAuth & Permissions**
  - Tap on **Install App to Workspace**
  - once the app is installed, you should see **Bot User OAuth Access Token**. Use this token to populate `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN`

### Dictionary

A sample dictionary can be found in `./assets/data/data.json`.  

```json
[
    {
        "term":"word",
        "definition":"the default action is to create or update. If 'word' is not found, it will be added."
    },
    {
        "term":"word",
        "definition":"if it alreadt exists, this will update the definition of 'word'"
    },
    {
        "term":"word",
        "definition":"this doesn't really matter, as the term will be deleted",
        "action":"delete"
    }
]
```

### Environment

Variables that must be in your (CI) environment to successfully deploy the stacks.  

| Variable Name | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` | Your AWS Account Access Key |
| `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` | Your AWS Account Access Secret Key |
| `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION` | Your Default AWS Region|
| `COVERALLS_REPO_TOKEN` | (Optional) Your Coveralls repo token to enable coverage history and badge. |
| `SLACK_CHALLENGE_TOKEN` | The callenge token. You won't have this on your first deploy. Retrieve this in your CloudWatch logs once you have verified your Slack App. More info in [this](http://) section. |
| `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` | It's the bot token you get when you register your bot user in Slack App. It begins with `xoxb-` |
| `SLACK_TEST_CHANNEL` | The id of the channel you want to run tests into. You can find it by right-clicking on the channel name and selecting `Copy Link`. The id is the last element of the path in it. E.g., in `https://my-workspace.slack.com/messages/C01234567`, the id is `C01234567`|

## Run

### CircleCI

You can deploy this via CircleCI by forking this repository, creating a CircleCI account [here](https://circleci.com) and enabling this repository.  
Make sure you configure the job with the provided environmental variables.

### Locally

Install NodeJS 8.10 (use of `nvm` is recommended).  

```bash
nvm use # optional
npm i -g serverless
npm i
npm run test:local # won't ship coverage report to coverall
make deploy-local
make seed-local
```

## Test

### Unit Test

```bash
nvm use
nmp i
npm run test:local # won't ship coverage report to coverall
```

### End 2 End

```bash
nvm use
npm i -g serverless
npm i
make deploy-local
#Â make sure all the environmental variables are set
npm run test:e2e
```

## Seeding

You can seed the bot by placing your definitions in `./assets/data/data.json` and running from your machine

```bash
make seed-local
```

or you can seed the bot yourself by running

```bash
BUCKET_NAME=$(cat serverless-info.json | jq -r .DefinitionBucketName )
aws s3 cp ./path/to/your/data s3://${BUCKET_NAME}
```
